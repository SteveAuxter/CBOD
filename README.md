# Introduction
Chromebooks On Demand (CBOD) is a utility that uses device information exported from Google Workspace and presents it in an easy to use webUI.

CBOD is written in PHP/HTML and uses a MySQL database to store device info. CBOD requires an AMP instance - it has been built and tested extensively with WAMPSERVER. I imagine MAMP, XAMPP or any custom LAMP configuration would also work.

CBOD requires a working instance of GAMADV-XTD3 (https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3).
